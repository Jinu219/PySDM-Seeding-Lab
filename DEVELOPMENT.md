# Development Notes

## Step 0. Clean project scaffold

Legacy experiment traces were removed to start PySDM Seeding Lab as a new independent simulation platform.

Changes:
- Removed sample experiment folders from `experiments/`
- Removed legacy experiment preset configuration
- Kept `experiments/.gitkeep` to preserve the directory
- Updated README project description and roadmap

Recommended commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "Remove legacy experiment traces from project scaffold"
```

## Step 1. Define initial configuration schema

The project now has a canonical configuration schema.

Changes:
- Added `simulation/schema.py`
- Added `schema_version`
- Standardized `configs/default.yaml`
- Standardized `configs/marine.yaml`
- Standardized `configs/urban.yaml`
- Updated `simulation/config.py` to normalize missing fields
- Updated `simulation/validation.py` to validate schema-level constraints
- Added helper functions for nested config access

Recommended commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "Define initial YAML configuration schema"
```

## Step 2. Stabilize Streamlit input pages

The Streamlit interface was updated to use the official configuration schema.

Changes:
- Added `simulation/ui_helpers.py`
- Improved main app overview
- Added scenario loading into `configs/default.yaml`
- Updated environment input page
- Updated aerosol input page with distribution preview
- Updated seeding input page with injection-time constraints
- Updated dynamics input page with direct/future input separation
- Improved run and results pages
- Added schema summary expanders to input pages

Recommended commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "Stabilize Streamlit parameter input pages"
```

## Step 3. Strengthen validation

The validation system now provides structured validation issues with severity levels.

Changes:
- Added `ValidationIssue` dataclass
- Added `validate_config_detailed()`
- Added `validation_summary()`
- Added `validation_report_rows()`
- Kept `validate_config()` backward-compatible by returning blocking error messages only
- Updated Run page to display validation metrics and a detailed report table
- Updated main app page to show validation status
- Added more physical and workflow checks for environment, aerosol, seeding, dynamics, microphysics, and output settings

Recommended commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "Strengthen configuration validation workflow"
```
